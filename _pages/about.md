Welcome to my website! 

<!-- > **Update**: I will begin my PhD with [Prof. Danilo Mandic](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/d.mandic/about) at Imperial College London in Oct 2025, focusing on interpretable and efficient AI. -->

I am currently a first-year PhD student at [AIDA lab](https://www.aidalab.co.uk/), [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), supervised by Prof.[Danilo Mandic](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/d.mandic/about). My research interest includes generative artificial intelligence (genAI) for natural language processing (NLP), and AI for finance. The research is fully funded by the EEE department.

I graduated with a first-class MEng degree in Electrical and Information Engineering (EIE) from Imperial as well. You can read more about my undergraduate journey on the [the department website](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/study/phd/yuxuan/). As part of the program, I spent 6 months at [Arm](https://www.arm.com/) as my industrial placement, where I worked on the design of the design of next-generation AI processor.

<!-- My name is Yuxuan Gu, and I am currently pursuing an MEng degree in Electrical and Information Engineering (EIE) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). As a final-year student, I am deeply passionate about engineering, with a strong focus on **machine learning**, alongside other interests in CPU design, robotics, and control systems. My dedication to this field has driven me to excel academically, placing me in the **top 5%** of my cohort and earning me the **Dean's list** honor for the **past three consecutive years**. -->

Outside of my research, I enjoy playing badminton and the violin. You can see my [violin performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NrQIz41Xvo) at 2022 Christmas concerts with the Chamber Music Society in Imperial College London. Engaging in music and sports allows me to relax, develop my creativity, and find inspiration.
